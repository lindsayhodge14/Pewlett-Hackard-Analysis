# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7: SQL

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project is to create two tables which illustrate the number of employees retiring per title and the number of employees who are elligible to participate in a mentorship program. These tables will assist Bobby's manager in his preperation for the "silver tsunami."

## Analysis
As can be seen in the reitiring_titles.csv, the silver tsunami is going to bemost prominent amongst senior engineers and staff. 

* The loss of senior staff and senior engineers is individually greater than all the other titles combined.
* Beyond senior leadership, engineers constitute thelargest group of retirees.
* Overall, 72,458 employees are set to retire.

Considering the loss ofhighly experienced and educated staff, it is vital that the company be prepared to fulfill such critical roles with new/up-and-coming talent. The mentorship_elligibility.csv helps to identify such individuals.

* Only 1,550 employees have been identified for mentorship elligibility. 

## Summary
With 72,458 employees retiring and just 1,550 employees being identified as potential mentees, it is importantfor Pewlett-Hackard to anticipate the "silver tsunami" by devoting significant resources to recruiting middle-management/experirenced talent. Establishing a program that sets young employees on track to assume upper management roles would also be beneficial.
